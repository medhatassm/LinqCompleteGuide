# Programming Paradigm

1. Declarative (Functional , logic).
2. Dynamic compile time at runtime.
3. Event Driven Programming.
4. Generic Programming.
5. Imperative Programming OOP, Procedural, Reflective.
6. Meta programming Use the code as data.

> Any line end with `;` called statement.
> 

> **Expression**: yield a value `var area =` `3.14 * (10 * 10);` (right side ⇒ Expression Statement).

## Pure & Impure Function

### Impure Function

interaction with outside world, different input and output, has side effect, harder to test, unreadable by other.

### Pure Function

can’t interaction with outside world, same input same output, has no side effect, easier to test, readable.

- Robust and testable code.
- prefere declarative over imperative coding.

## Functional Programming

- programming paradigm for developer software using function (pure).
- functional programming is the key part of functional programming.

> When we use regular way to get data (from any where) with impure function, we face two problem.
1. External Dependencies. (solution ⇒ Get the data as parameters).
2. Imperative code. (solution ⇒ Using delegate to pass your login (High order function)).
